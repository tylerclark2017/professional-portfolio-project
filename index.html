    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Tyler Clark. I am currently a Congressional healthcare lobbyist who is also enrolled in the GW Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, scheduled to finish in May 2024. I am incredibly ambitious about finding 
        employment in the tech industry once I am Full-Stack Certified.
    </p>
    <p>I would love to be able to showcase the skills I have learned throughout this bootcamp
        to assist my future employer create products, maintain operating systems, or even develop applications
        that will be used by many. I am very excited to get started on my career in tech!
