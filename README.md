## Information About This Challenge
This challenge was meant to teach us how to utilize CSS in order to not only style websites, but also make them responsive so that they properly function on different device widths and sizes, such as mobile phone and tablets. I will continually update this, as it is more or less a great way for potential employers to get in contact with us and see what we can truly do as developers. There is plenty to be added to this to improve the Completed and In Progress Projects section to expand on my abilities, which I will continually add to as the bootcamp continues. 

## Comments and Clarification
I did utilize the AI learning assistant to help me clarify which CSS properties were needed to make my website be properly responsive on different devices. I am hoping that overall, this is a good start towards eventually mastering CSS, even though I know there is still plenty of room for improvement. I understand if the grading for this is a bit rougher than the last Challenge. Please let me know of any ways I can continue to improve my CSS abilities, not just for this challenge!
